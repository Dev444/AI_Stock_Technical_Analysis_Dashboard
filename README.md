# AI-Powered Technical Stock Analysis Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit that provides technical analysis for stocks. It fetches stock data using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) and creates dynamic candlestick charts with Plotly. Additionally, it leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to analyze these charts and provide detailed trading recommendations based on selected technical indicators.
